# Face Finder

**_Created By Abhin & Mohit_**

**Project Begun on Aug 8th 2022**

This web application is built using the React framework, along with various libaries such as
Bootstrap. We use a face sorting algorithm by "**insert**" to help our application to allow
users to upload an image to determine who the celebrity is then displays it to the user.
Along with this there are some other features of the website such as "**insert or delete**".

## After Git Cloning the React Application from git

check if the package.json file is good, specifically the scripts
then you delete the package-lock.json
then delete any existing node module folders
after this in the terminal enter 'npm install'
after the install it should be good to go
